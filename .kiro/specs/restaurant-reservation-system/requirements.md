# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The restaurant table reservation system is a comprehensive online platform that enables guests to make, update, and cancel table reservations while providing restaurant employees with tools to manage and track all reservations. The system serves two primary user types: guests who need to reserve tables and restaurant staff who need to manage the reservation workflow from request to completion.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a guest submits a reservation with valid information THEN the system SHALL create a reservation with "Requested" status
3. WHEN creating a reservation THEN the system SHALL require guest name, contact info (phone and email), expected arrival time, and table size
4. WHEN a reservation is created THEN the system SHALL persist the data to the NoSQL database
5. WHEN a reservation is successfully created THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation to the guest

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a guest, I want to update my existing reservation, so that I can modify details if my plans change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest requests to update their reservation THEN the system SHALL allow modification of arrival time and table size
2. WHEN a guest updates their reservation THEN the system SHALL maintain the current status unless changed by restaurant staff
3. WHEN reservation updates are saved THEN the system SHALL persist changes to the database
4. WHEN a reservation is updated THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation to the guest

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a guest, I want to cancel my reservation, so that I can free up the table if I can no longer attend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest requests to cancel their reservation THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Cancelled"
2. WHEN a reservation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL persist the status change to the database
3. WHEN a cancellation is processed THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation to the guest

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a restaurant employee, I want to manage reservation statuses, so that I can track the reservation workflow from request to completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a restaurant employee accesses a reservation THEN the system SHALL allow status updates to "Approved", "Cancelled", or "Completed"
2. WHEN an employee updates a reservation status THEN the system SHALL persist the change to the database
3. WHEN a status is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of status changes
4. IF a reservation status is "Completed" THEN the system SHALL not allow further modifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a restaurant employee, I want to browse all reservations by date and status, so that I can efficiently manage the restaurant's booking schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee accesses the reservation management interface THEN the system SHALL display reservations filtered by date
2. WHEN an employee selects a status filter THEN the system SHALL display only reservations matching that status
3. WHEN browsing reservations THEN the system SHALL display guest name, arrival time, table size, and current status
4. WHEN viewing the reservation list THEN the system SHALL support sorting by arrival time and status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a restaurant employee, I want to view detailed reservation information, so that I can contact guests when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee selects a specific reservation THEN the system SHALL display all reservation details including contact information
2. WHEN viewing reservation details THEN the system SHALL show guest name, phone, email, arrival time, table size, and status
3. WHEN accessing contact information THEN the system SHALL provide clickable phone and email links for easy communication

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to have proper authentication, so that only authorized users can access employee functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing employee functions THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL provide access to reservation management features
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and display appropriate error messages
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL only allow guest reservation functions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide user-friendly messages
3. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses

2. WHEN implementing business services THEN the system SHALL provide GraphQL endpoints
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate input data and return appropriate responses
4. WHEN using GraphQL THEN the system SHALL support queries and mutations for reservation operations

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive unit tests, so that code quality and functionality can be verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria
